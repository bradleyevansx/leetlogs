## Current Problem Set

### Blind 75 ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Progress-1%2F75-0078D4)

The Blind 75 is a list of questions curated by an ex-meta engineer.

My goal in completing this set of questions is to force myself to finish a set of questions that includes all the important types of data structures and algorithms.

## Repository Structure

Each topic has it's own directory and each problem a directory within it's topic.

Each topic will contain a **README** file with an introduction to the various topics as well as common techiniques for solving problems within said topic.

## How To Use This Repository

You can search for problems by topic.

Each topic will have an in depth explaination of the data structure or algorithm.

Feel free to open up a pull request and add to my explanations.

## Repository Generation

The entire repo is regenerated before pushing (eventually via github action).

All the data within the repository is held within the index.py file in the root directory.

You can generate all the files by running:

```zsh
python3 index.py
```

I did it this way so that I can change the formatting of all the README files in one place.
